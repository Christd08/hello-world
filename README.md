# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Christian, I'm 23 years old and a programming student!!
I'm looking for knowledge in JavaScript and python, with focus on Front-End development (React, Redux, Django) and some Back-End like Node.JS, Express and others!!

I'm on basic levels but my goal is to be a Good React programmer and start to learn Next.JS by the end of this year (2021).
